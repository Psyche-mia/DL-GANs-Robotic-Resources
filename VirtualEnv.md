# Virtual Environment

```python3 -m venv environment-name```

```source environment-name/bin/activate```



  Run ```conda create -n venv_name``` and ```source activate venv_name```, where venv_name is the name of your virtual environment.

  Run ```conda install pip```. This will install pip to your venv directory.

  Find your anaconda directory, and find the actual venv folder. It should be somewhere like ```/anaconda/envs/venv_name/```.

  Install new packages by doing ```/anaconda/envs/venv_name/bin/pip install package_name```.
